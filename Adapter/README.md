The Adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces of classes to work
together by creating a wrapper or adapter class. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, converting the
interface of one class into another interface that clients expect. The adapter pattern helps in achieving
interoperability between classes and promotes code reusability.

You should consider using the Adapter pattern in the following scenarios:

1.When you want to use an existing class, but its interface is incompatible with the rest of your codebase or another
class.
2.When you need to integrate third-party libraries or components that have incompatible interfaces with your application.
3.When you want to create a reusable class that can work with multiple unrelated or incompatible classes.

In this example, we have a LegacyPrinter class that has its own print method, which is incompatible with the
PrinterInterface interface. The PrinterAdapter class acts as an adapter, implementing the PrinterInterface and
internally using the LegacyPrinter to perform the printing. The client code interacts with the PrinterAdapter, unaware
of the underlying implementation details.

By using the Adapter pattern, you can seamlessly integrate the LegacyPrinter with the rest of your codebase or other
classes that expect the PrinterInterface.
